I'm open to some spare time meetings and coding, so if you have a project I can help with, or if you just wanna chat, feel free to contact me. My goal is to never settle, by being open to new challenges and willing to learn new things that can promote the quality of my work, and be a positive force among the people around me. I've always loved creating things, that's probably why I got into music, and later on, programming. On the backend side I work a lot with Node JS and C#, while my frontend experience is mostly dominated by React/Typescript.<br><br>When I'm not hammering my keyboard for programming, I'm probably hanging out with my beautiful wife or my friends, jogging, strumming my guitar or hammering my keyboard some more playing video games.",

Manually. Even in gaming sessions. That's an interuption you don't want and it's quite tedious having to remeber to drag and drop folders everyday, so I thought, \"I should make a script for that!\". So I made a bash script that now has become my standard script for automating server or log backups.  ",
